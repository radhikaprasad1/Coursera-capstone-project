Not only is it a relatively capital and employee-intensive business, restaurants are also highly regulated, low margin and in most cases have a plethora of competition to deal with. There are more dining establishments and more diners now than during any other time in history; the National Restaurant Association reports over 1 million restaurant locations in the U.S. alone, a particular boon considering more than half the American population visits at least one of them each week. To fill a niche and remain relevant, prospective, as well as established, restaurants have to hedge their bets with well-rounded and well-directed dataset. Data science provides valuable insights regarding market trends and evolving consumer lifestyles so that restaurateurs can better address and meet public demand.\n\n### Business Problem\n\nRestaurant is a place where people come to have food and drinks for a cost, People love to do many things and try something new or stick with their own routines, it depends on the individual and there are so many of them with different cultural and various aspects in New York city. There are so many cuisines, which is based on the style of cooking, the ingredients, dishes and techniques. For our problem lets stick with Indian cuisine.\n\nMy client, a successful Indian restaurant chain in Hyderabad-India is looking to expand operation into North America through New York (NYC), so here are all the factors we have to take into account such as follows:\n\n -  Market Places <br> \n -  Competition in particular location<br>\n -  Aiding places that make people come to restaurants like Gym, Entertaining Public places<br>\n -  Population<br>\n -  Menu from competitors<br>\n\nAnd so on... So our solution needs to be data driven for avoiding or considering low risk criteria and high success rate and thus apply our overall knowledge in the techniques and the tools gained so far in this course."
